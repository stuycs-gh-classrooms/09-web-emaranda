    <p>
      Kamala Khan first gets her superpowers after Terrigen Mist is spread throughout Jersey City. The mist awakens her Inhuman powers. After leaving a party, Kamala is walking when the Terrigen Mist hits. She passes out and wakes up in the body of Captain Marvel. She rescues Zoe Zimmer, a girl at her school who almost drowns after getting drunk.
       In addition to being able to shapeshift, Kamala can stretch her limbs and change her body shape (she can embiggen and shrink). She also has the ability to heal herself, but she can't heal if she has shapeshifted. In the beginning, Ms. Marvel can both shapeshift and stretch her body, but as she continues to use her powers, she must choose one of the two.

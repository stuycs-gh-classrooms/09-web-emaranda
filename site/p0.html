    <h1>Friends, Family, and Fellow Heros</h1>
    <h2>Friends</h2>
    <p>
      Kamala Khan's best friends are Bruno Carrelli and Nakia Bahadir. Bruno is Kamala's only friend who knows her superhero identity, and often aids her on her superhero missions with his techonolgy and scientific skills. He works at the Circle Q, a convience store close to Coles Academic High School. He has had a crush on Kamala since the second grade, but once Kamala rejects him, saying she must focus on being a superhero, Bruno starts to date Michaela "Mike" Gutierrez Miller. 
      Nakia is also a student at Coles Academic High School and goes to the same mosque as Kamala's family. She is a activist who wants to make change in her community.
    </p>
    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>
      Kamala's parents are Yusuf and Muneeba Khan. They immigrated to New Jersey from Karachi, Pakistan. They know about Kamala's Ms. Marvel identity, and they often show concern for Kamala when her life gets too overwhelming. Her older brother is Aamir Khan, a devout Muslim who spends most of his time volunteering or at the mosque.
    </p>
    <h2>Superheros</h2>
    <p>
      Ms. Marvel is part of the Champions, a groups of young superheros who, after leaving the Avengers, wanted to create their own group without the flaws of the Avengers. The main Champions include Ms. Marvel, Spiderman (Miles Morales), Nova, Viv (the daughter of Vision), and the Hulk (Amadeus Cho). After rescuing a group of girls from being trafficked, the Champions go viral on social media and the team is created. In some of the comics, Kamala has a giant teleporting dog named Lockjaw. Lockjaw was sent by Medusa, queen of the Inhumans, and helps Kamala to defeat the Inventor. Kamala is also a mentor to Moon Girl (Lunella Lafayette). Lunella is a 10 year old Inhuman from the Lower East Side and fights crime with a giant dinosaur.

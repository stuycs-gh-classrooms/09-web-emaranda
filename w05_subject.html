<h2>Snoopy's Origins</h2>
    <p>Snoopy is the pet beagle of Charlie Brown. He has 7 siblings: Spike, Belle, Marbles, Olaf, Andy, and two other unnamed siblings. He is adopted by Charlie Brown in a farm from his previous owner Lila. He first appears in the <a href="https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/10/04">October 4, 1950 comic</a>. In the beginning of the comics, Snoopy acts like a dog and walks on all fours. As the comic goes on, he becomes his own character as acts more like a person and walks on two feet. He sleeps on top of his doghouse instead of inside and sleeps on his back. </p>
